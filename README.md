# Causal-Inference
Causal inference can be defined as the process by which causes are inferred from the data. 
In this project, data from breast cancer diagnosis is analyzed and causes inferred from this analysis.

# Steps followed
1. Perform a causal inference task using Pearlâ€™s framework;
2. Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph
3. Merge machine learning with causal inference;

# Data and Features
The data is extracted from Kaggle.. Features in the data are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

### Attribute Information:
1. ID number
2. Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
### The remaining (3-32)
1. Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
2. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
3. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
4. Perimeter
5. Area
6. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
7. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
8. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
9. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
10. Symmetry

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features
